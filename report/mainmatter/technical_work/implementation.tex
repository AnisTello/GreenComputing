Since we know that objects that are not referenced will be removed from memory by the garbage collector.
And in order to realise this study I have modified an open source application\cite{GCTest} which test garbage collection behavior so the application would generate a larg number of objects and then remove the reference pointing to these objects.\\
Each minute a separate thread calls System.gc() to encourage JVM to run the garbage collector.\\
Using PowerAPI\cite{powerAPI}: ''wattmeter software based on a model of actors, en uses this model to estimate software energetic consumption''\cite{powerAPIFR}
