In this study I succeeded in showing the energy consumption of different Garbage Collection mechanism in Java Virtual machine using PowerAPI a tool for measuring the energy consumption of softwares running on a machine.\\ This study shows that Serial Garbage collector is the most consuming Garbage collectors while ConcMarkSweep is the least.
This study can be extended in the future to be cover real world programs on large period of times.
